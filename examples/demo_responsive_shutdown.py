BEFORE: When you pressed Ctrl+C during processing:
1. Signal handler triggered cleanup
2. Main thread still blocked waiting for Redis result (10s timeout)
3. Process hung until timeout expired
4. Poor user experience - appeared frozen

AFTER: Immediate response to Ctrl+C:
1. Signal handler triggers cleanup AND sets shutdown event
2. process_request() races between result and shutdown signal
3. Shutdown signal wins - immediate cancellation
4. Clean exit within milliseconds
