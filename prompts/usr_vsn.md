Analyze this image for technical documentation purposes. First, assess the image's complexity (e.g., simple like a single button or icon, or complex like a full UI screen, diagram, or chart). Tailor the level of detail accordingly: keep it concise and focused for simple images, expanding comprehensively for complex ones.

Provide a structured description covering the following sections where applicableâ€”omit any that are irrelevant:

1. **Image Type Classification**: Identify if this is a screenshot, diagram, UI interface, code snippet, chart, or other type.
2. **Main Content Description**: Describe the primary content, layout, and visual elements. Be brief for simple images.
3. **UI Elements (if applicable)**: List visible buttons, fields, menus, tabs, icons, and interactive elements with their labels and approximate positions.
4. **Text Content**: Extract and transcribe ALL visible text, including window titles, headers, button labels, field values, error messages, or any other readable text.
5. **Technical Details (if applicable)**: Note software interface elements, configuration settings, system information, code, commands, or diagrams.
6. **Functional Purpose (if applicable)**: Explain the likely use of this interface, screen, or diagram in the overall system.
7. **User Interaction (if applicable)**: Describe potential user actions or interactions.

Focus on accuracy, completeness, and professionalism. For simple images, prioritize brevity; for complex ones, ensure thoroughness suitable for user guides or documentation.
