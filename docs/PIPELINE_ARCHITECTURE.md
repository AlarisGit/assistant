# RAG Assistant Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive agent architecture for the industry-agnostic RAG-based documentation assistant. The system uses a dynamic flow with intelligent routing decisions powered by LLM analysis rather than rigid pattern matching.

## Current Implementation Status (v2.3)

### ✅ **Implemented Agents**
- **ManagerAgent**: Dynamic pipeline orchestrator with intelligent routing
- **LangAgent**: Language detection using conversation history patterns  
- **TranslationAgent**: Mandatory translation and text normalization
- **EssenceAgent**: Context-aware canonical question extraction with temporal context
- **ResponseAgent**: LLM-powered response generation
- **ClarificationAgent**: Polite, localized clarification message composition

### 🚧 **Planned Agents** (Future RAG Enhancement)
- **GuardrailsAgent**: Documentation scope enforcement
- **SearchAgent**: Multi-level RAG search across documentation
- **AugmentationAgent**: Enhanced LLM prompt crafting with search context
- **QualityAgent**: Response validation with pipeline retry capability

### 🎯 **Recent Major Improvements**
1. **Enhanced Temporal Context** (v2.3):
   - Timestamped conversation history with format `[YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS]`
   - Current time awareness for LLM temporal understanding
   - Conversation evolution tracking across clarifications

2. **Context-Aware Canonical Questions** (v2.3):
   - **RAG-ready questions** that include domain/topic context from conversation
   - **Self-contained queries** that work without conversation history
   - **Perspective preservation** - never flips user intent direction
   - **Critical for RAG success**: Transforms generic questions into searchable, contextual queries

3. **Universal Clarification System** (v2.2):
   - Any agent can request clarification when uncertain
   - Prevents hallucinations and pipeline failures
   - Consistent user experience across all uncertainty scenarios

## Core Principles

1. **Industry-Agnostic**: Based on universal data structure patterns, not domain-specific knowledge
2. **LLM-Powered Decisions**: Intelligent routing using AI analysis, not pattern matching
3. **Dynamic Flow**: Conversations can be interrupted, redirected, or returned to previous steps
4. **Security-First**: Guardrails enforce documentation-only responses
5. **Data-Driven**: Leverages all available metadata from RAG pipeline

## Data Structure Foundation

The architecture is built around the standardized document structure from the RAG pipeline:

```json
{
  "id": "doc-id-hash",
  "source": "https://domain.com/path",
  "crumbs": ["Category", "Subcategory", "Topic"],
  "description": "Brief description",
  "content": "Full content with image descriptions", 
  "summary": "LLM-generated summary",
  "keypoints": ["Point 1", "Point 2"],
  "keywords": ["term1", "term2"],
  "chunks": ["chunk1", "chunk2"]
}
```

## Core Architecture Principles

### Centralized Routing Authority
**Critical Design Rule**: Only the **ManagerAgent** has routing authority in the system.

- **All agents** (except ManagerAgent) process messages and return results via **default routing**
- **Only ManagerAgent** examines agent outputs and sets `target_role` for next pipeline step
- **No agent** directly routes messages to other agents or modifies `target_role`
- **ManagerAgent** acts as the central orchestrator, making all routing decisions based on agent analysis results

This ensures:
- **Predictable message flow** with single point of control
- **Simplified agent logic** focused on processing, not routing
- **Centralized pipeline state management** in ManagerAgent
- **Clear separation of concerns** between processing and orchestration

### Performance and Concurrency
**Critical Performance Rule**: LLM-backed agents must have multiple instances to prevent blocking.

**Instance Configuration**:
- **Single instances** (fast, non-LLM): ManagerAgent, LangAgent, CommandAgent
- **Multiple instances** (LLM-backed): All other agents (2+ instances each)

**Rationale**:
- LLM calls can have 1-10+ second latency
- Single LLM agent instances create pipeline bottlenecks
- Multiple instances enable concurrent processing
- Non-LLM agents (routing, language detection) are fast enough for single instances

### Unified Clarification System
**Critical Design Rule**: Any agent can request clarification when uncertain, preventing hallucinations and pipeline failures.

**Clarification Protocol**:
- **Any agent** can set `needs_clarification = true` when uncertain about user intent, scope, context, or quality
- **Requesting agent** should also set `clarification_reason` and basic `clarification_message`
- **ManagerAgent** detects clarification requests and routes to **ClarificationAgent**
- **ClarificationAgent** crafts polite, comprehensive, localized user responses for ALL refusal scenarios
- **No agent** should hallucinate or fail silently when facing any uncertainty

**Clarification as Universal Refusal**: Clarification is the polite, professional way to refuse answering regardless of reason (ambiguity, vagueness, out-of-scope, insufficient details, quality issues).

**Universal Clarification Attributes** (any agent can write):
- `needs_clarification` - Boolean indicating uncertainty requiring user input
- `clarification_reason` - Reason code: "ambiguous_query", "insufficient_context", "scope_unclear", "multiple_topics", "missing_details", "out_of_scope", "quality_insufficient"
- `clarification_message` - Agent-specific message explaining what clarification is needed

**Benefits**:
- **Prevents hallucinations**: Agents request clarification instead of guessing
- **Graceful degradation**: Pipeline doesn't break on ambiguous inputs
- **Consistent UX**: All clarification requests handled uniformly by ClarificationAgent
- **Localized communication**: Clarification messages automatically translated to user's language
- **Context-aware messaging**: Uses conversation history and agent context for better clarification
- **Improved accuracy**: Better user input leads to better responses

## Agent Definitions

- Conversation memory integration and user preference tracking
- Pipeline interruption and return handling

**Routing Architecture**:
- **All other agents** process messages and return results to ManagerAgent via default routing
- **Only ManagerAgent** examines results and determines next pipeline step
- **No agent** (except ManagerAgent) directly routes messages to other agents

**Envelope Attributes**:
- **Reads**:
  - `stage` - Current pipeline stage for routing decisions

### Envelope Structure and Attribute Separation

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RULE**: Agents operate on `envelope.payload` dictionary, NOT on envelope system attributes.

#### System-Level Envelope Attributes
**Managed by BaseAgent framework - NEVER modify directly in agent code**:
- `conversation_id` - Unique conversation identifier
- `message_id` - Unique message identifier  
- `create_ts` - Message creation timestamp
- `update_ts` - Last modification timestamp
- `process_count` - Safety circuit breaker counter
- `total_processing_time` - Cumulative processing time
- `sender_role` - Previous agent that sent message

#### Routing Control Attributes
**System-managed with controlled agent access**:
- `target_role` - Next agent role to process message (**ONLY ManagerAgent sets this**)
- `target_list` - Result list for pipeline completion (system-managed)
- `result_list` - Final result destination (system-managed)

#### Application-Level Payload Attributes
**Managed by agents via `envelope.payload` dictionary**:
- `text` - Original user input
- `stage` - Current pipeline stage
- `language` - Detected/preferred language
- `response` - Final response to user
- All other agent-specific attributes (search_results, canonical_question, etc.)

#### Agent Implementation Rule
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Agents work with payload
env.payload['canonical_question'] = processed_query
env.payload['search_results'] = results

# ❌ WRONG: Never modify system attributes directly
env.conversation_id = "new_id"  # FORBIDDEN
env.process_count = 0           # FORBIDDEN
env.target_role = "other"       # FORBIDDEN (except ManagerAgent)
```

### Data Flow Patterns

**Language Processing Chain:**
```
text → language, confidence → text_eng → canonical_question
```

**Search and Context Chain:**
```
canonical_question → search_results, search_context → augmented_prompt → response
```

**Quality and Routing Chain:**
```
guardrails_routing → search_quality → needs_clarification → quality_decision
```

## Key Achievements (v2.3)

### 🎯 **Context-Aware RAG Compatibility**
**Problem Solved**: Generic canonical questions break RAG search
- **Before**: "Why are two stages needed?" → RAG search fails (no context)
- **After**: "Why are two stages needed in rocket launches and space missions?" → RAG finds relevant documents

**Impact**: This breakthrough ensures RAG components can find relevant documents without needing full conversation history, making the system truly scalable and effective.

### ⏰ **Enhanced Temporal Context**
**Innovation**: First agentic system with comprehensive temporal awareness
- **Timestamped conversation history**: `[2025.09.28 21:52:32] User message content`
- **Current time context**: LLM knows current time vs message timestamps
- **Conversation evolution tracking**: Understands how intent changes over time

**Benefits**: Better context resolution, improved clarification decisions, temporal pattern recognition.

### 🔄 **Universal Clarification System**
**Design Excellence**: Any agent can request clarification when uncertain
- **Prevents hallucinations**: Agents ask for clarification instead of guessing
- **Consistent UX**: All uncertainty handled uniformly by ClarificationAgent
- **Graceful degradation**: Pipeline never breaks on ambiguous inputs

### 🎛️ **Centralized Routing Authority**
**Architectural Principle**: Only ManagerAgent controls message flow
- **Simplified agent logic**: Agents focus on processing, not routing
- **Predictable flow**: Single point of control for all routing decisions
- **Clean separation**: Processing vs orchestration concerns separated
